## What is Wordle?

Wordle is a five letter word guessing game. You get six tries to guess the right word and every time you guess a word, you get feedback regarding the letters.

A Green feedback on a letter means the letter is correct and on the correct spot in the word.

A Yellow feedback on a letter means that letter is present in the word but in wrong spot.

A Gray feedback means the letter is not present at all in the word.

## How to Play

- Connect Mina Auro Wallet on Berkeley Testnet.
- Fund the wallet with free testnet Mina from the faucet.
- Guess the Wordle of the day using the keyboard.
- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
- The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
- You have maximum 6 tries to guess the correct word.
